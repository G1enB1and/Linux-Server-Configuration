from aws terminal as ubuntu (root):

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get autoremove
$ sudo apt-get install finger
$ sudo adduser --home /home/student --shell /bin/bash --ingroup admin student
$ sudo adduser --home /home/grader --shell /bin/bash --ingroup admin grader
$ sudo touch /etc/sudoers.d/student
$ sudo nano /etc/sudoers.d/student
add the following line:
student ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
ctrl o (write file/save) enter to save as name given
ctrl x (exit)
$ sudo cp /etc/sudoers.d/student /etc/sudoers.d/grader
$ sudo nano /etc/sudoers.d/grader
change student to grader
ctrl o (write file/save) enter to save as name given
ctrl x (exit)



from local terminal:
to login as ubuntu (root): (the key .pem file must be in same directory)
$ ssh ubuntu@52.2.70.241 -i LightsailDefaultKey-us-east-1.pem

to make a new key for student:
$ ssh-keygen -b 1024 -f student -t dsa

output:
Your identification has been saved in student.
Your public key has been saved in student.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:uJid2uA4fFJOY7uXQBkp1qSvRybfed/DtXchRkJLVF0 gbland@8DMSR12
The key's randomart image is:

Now, copy the file to the server’s tmp directory (from local terminal logged out - this command will log in to copy the file):

$ scp -i LightsailDefaultKey-us-east-1.pem student.pub ubuntu@52.2.70.241:/tmp/

Back on the server, copy this file to the home directory of the user we just created:

$ sudo su student
$ cd ~
$ mkdir .ssh
$ cat /tmp/student.pub > .ssh/authorized_keys
$ chmod 600 .ssh/*
$ chmod 700 .ssh/

You should now be able to connect to the server using your newly created username without having to specify a password:

$ ssh student@52.2.70.241

student@52.2.70.241: Permission denied (publickey).

new method:

$ ssh-copy-id -i grader.pub grader@52.2.70.241

/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "grader.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter
out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
grader@52.2.70.241: Permission denied (publickey).

troubleshooting:
logged in as ubuntu:
$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
uncommented the line that says "PubkeyAuthentication yes"
ctrl o (to save)
ctrl x (to exit nano)
reboot server through lightsail website.

retry:
$ ssh-copy-id -i grader.pub grader@52.2.70.241
same result.
