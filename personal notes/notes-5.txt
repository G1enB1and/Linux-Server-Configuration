$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
# copy files
# pip install -r requirements.txt

by default gunicorn only listens to requests from localhost and on port 8000.
The following command tells it to listen from the internet at large and on port 80.

gunicorn hello:app --log-file - --bind 0.0.0.0:80



Working with Virtual Environments
Virtual environments have the advantage that they never install the required dependencies system wide so you have a better control over what is used where. If you want to use a virtual environment with mod_wsgi you have to modify your .wsgi file slightly.

Add the following lines to the top of your .wsgi file:

activate_this = '/path/to/env/bin/activate_this.py'
execfile(activate_this, dict(__file__=activate_this))




Problem: application gives permission errors
Probably caused by your application running as the wrong user. 
Make sure the folders the application needs access to have the proper 
privileges set and the application runs as the correct user 
(user and group parameter to the WSGIDaemonProcess directive)
