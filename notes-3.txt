to create a user:

add user
$ sudo adduser <username>
switch to the root user
$ sudo su
add a password for that user
$ passwd <username>


to enable sudo for user:
now add the user to sudoers list by running
$ visudo
search for [root ALL = (ALL) ALL]
add [<username> ALL = (ALL) ALL] just below it.
esc :wq to write and quit
or you could use nano instead of visudo

to switch to a user:
$ su <username>

to delete a user:
$ sudo userdel -rf <username>

Public and Private Keys for Users:

switch to the user directory:
$ cd /home/<username>/

generate keys:
$ ssh-keygen -b4096 -f <username> -t rsa

make a .ssh folder inside the user folder:
$ mkdir .ssh

set permission for owner of file to read, write, and execute:
$ chmod 700 .ssh

store public key in authorized keys file:
$ cat <username>.pub > .ssh/authorized_keys

set permission for owner to read and write to the file:
$ chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys

-below section might need to chnage group name to ubuntu or admin or sudo instead of ec2-user.
to set the owner to <username> and the group to ec2-user:
$ sudo chown <username>:ec2-user .ssh

to set the owner to <username> and the group to ec2-user:
$ sudo chown <username>:ec2-user .ssh/authorized_keys

to copy user:
$ sudo cp <username> /home/ec2-user
or
$ sudo rsync -avr <username> /home/ec2-user/

set permissions:
$ sudo chmod 777 /home/ec2-user/<username>

-- Using your local terminal --
again, ec2-user may need to be "ubuntu" instead.

to copy the key "<username>" from your AWS Server:
$ scp -i <username.pem> ec2-user@<IP>:/home/ec2-user/<username> <username>
-above line might need sudo-

set permissions so than owner can read
$ chmod 400 <username>

to access aws server as this user:
$ ssh -i <key_just_created> <username>@<IP>
