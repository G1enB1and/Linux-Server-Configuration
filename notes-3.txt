to create a user:

add user
$ sudo adduser <username>
switch to the root user
$ sudo su
add a password for that user
$ passwd <username>


to enable sudo for user:
now add the user to sudoers list by running
$ visudo
search for [root ALL = (ALL) ALL]
add [<username> ALL = (ALL) ALL] just below it.
esc :wq to write and quit
or you could use nano instead of visudo

to switch to a user:
$ su <username>

to delete a user:
$ sudo userdel -rf <username>

Public and Private Keys for Users:

switch to the user directory:
$ cd /home/<username>/

generate keys:
$ ssh-keygen -b4096 -f <username> -t rsa

make a .ssh folder inside the user folder:
$ mkdir .ssh

set permission for owner of file to read, write, and execute:
$ chmod 700 .ssh

store public key in authorized keys file:
$ cat <username>.pub > .ssh/authorized_keys

set permission for owner to read and write to the file:
$ chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys

-below section might need to chnage group name to ubuntu or admin or sudo instead of ec2-user.
to set the owner to <username> and the group to ec2-user:
$ sudo chown <username>:ec2-user .ssh

to set the owner to <username> and the group to ec2-user:
$ sudo chown <username>:ec2-user .ssh/authorized_keys

to copy user:
$ sudo cp <username> /home/ec2-user
or
$ sudo rsync -avr <username> /home/ec2-user/

set permissions:
$ sudo chmod 777 /home/ec2-user/<username>

-- Using your local terminal --
again, ec2-user may need to be "ubuntu" instead.

to copy the key "<username>" from your AWS Server:
$ scp -i <username.pem> ec2-user@<IP>:/home/ec2-user/<username> <username>
-above line might need sudo-

set permissions so than owner can read
$ chmod 400 <username>

to access aws server as this user:
$ ssh -i <key_just_created> <username>@<IP>

help from mentor about flask:

How Can I verify that Flask is installed?

Testing outside virtual environment (venv)
Run:

$ pip freeze|grep -i flask

Should show something like:

Flask==1.0.2
Flask-Babel==0.11.2
Flask-Dance==0.14.0
Flask-HTTPAuth==3.2.3
Flask-Limiter==1.0.1
   (...)
If not, then Install flask: $ sudo pip install Flask After this, change directory to sys.path.insert: $ cd /var/www/html/catalog/

And run: $ python application.wsgi

Any error? Please, paste the error here. And paste your file application.wsgi

The statement

from catalogx import app as application

inside your application.wsgi file means:

Expects catalogx to be a folder with __init__.py inside. Or a file named: catalogx.py like: /var/www/html/catalog/catalogx.py

Next, run the following command to test if the installation is successful and the app is running:

$ python __init__.py

Virtual environment
Note: virtual env is not a requirement to pass.

Testing inside virtual environment (venv)
Basically, it is the same procedure. First of all activate the virtual environment with the following command:

$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv)  catalog$ 
From now on proceed as above to check up your installation. e.g.

(venv)  catalog$ pip freeze |grep -i flask
   (...)

---------------------

yes... the use virtualenv gives you the ability later to run more than a site on your machine.

it is easy and not complicated... so go for it

For installation:

$ sudo pip install virtualenv

Then create your virtualenv instance

$ sudo virtualenv <somename>

Then access that instance and pip install your packages inside of it, becareful not to use sudo when you do pip install, because otherwise you will install python packages outside of the virtualenv instance

$ source <somename>/bin/activate

(somename)$ pip install ....
